# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis – NLP Machine Learning Web App

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an **end-to-end Sentiment Analysis web application** built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**.  
The application predicts whether a given piece of text expresses **Positive or Negative sentiment**, along with a confidence score.

This is my **first NLP-based Machine Learning project of 2026**, focused on understanding real-world text data and deploying ML models as web applications.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Given a text input (review, comment, feedback, etc.), predict:
- **Positive sentiment**
- **Negative sentiment**

and display the result in real time using a modern web interface.

## 🧠 Machine Learning & NLP Approach

- **Dataset**: IMDb Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews (Kaggle)
- **Task Type**: Binary Text Classification
- **Algorithm Used**: Logistic Regression
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

The model was trained on real-world text data and then serialized for deployment.
